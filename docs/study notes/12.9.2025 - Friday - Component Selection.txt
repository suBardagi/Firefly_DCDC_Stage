12.9.2025 - Friday - Component Selection

There will be several component configurations int he simulation studies.

Combination - 1

PFC topology : Boost PFC - DC/DC Topology: Half Bridge LLC or 3-level FC LLC

-Primarily constructed around "PFS7539H-L" by Power Integrations. 
-Switching frequency will be 100kHz.(Because of the PFC IC)
-DC/DC topology will most likely switch at 100kHz also.(EMI reasons)
-System will be bulkier because of DC-Link and heavier magnetics/filters.
-For the MOSFET switches and gate driver circuitry there are 2 combinations. 
--Same MOSFETs and gate drivers can be used or they can be switched to "LMG3522R030" by Texas Instruments.

Combination -2 

AC/DC Topology : 3-level FCMC LLC 

-Switching frequency can be much higher.(250-500kHz range)
-System will be smaller because of the single stage.
-MOSFET and gate will be "LMG3522R030" by Texas Instruments.
-There will be no seperate PFC but the control will be more complex.

**Datasheets of PFS7539H-L and LMG3522R030 will be given with this commit.
